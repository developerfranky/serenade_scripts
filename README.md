# Serenade Scripts

## Workflows.js

Mostly general text editing commands and app navigation

If you have the same voice command for a global snippet and an app-specific snippet, the app-specific snippet must be defined first in the file.

### VS Code specific commands

Almost all commands use default VS Code keybindings except those with (\*)

\* Not a default VS code shortcut, requires custom keybinding before it can work  
\*\* Also not custom, but also requires for you to disable Mac OS default Mission Control shortcuts so you can free up cntrl (Ë†). Currently does [not work](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/87608) in Typescript React files (.tsx) in VS Code.
