# Serenade Scripts

## Workflows.js

Mostly general text editing commands and app navigation

General thinking is to avoid very long voice commands. I'd rather take things one step at at time and go through multiple steps/voice commands. 

For example, if I want to create a new branch, saying `"g checkout new sprint 92 slash snake case some new feature"` would be tedious in one breath and prone to misinterpretation. Instead, say `"g checkout new"` which focuses the terminal and types `git checkout -b ` with the cursor at the end where you can then say your branch name. Most commands will only type the core functionality and place the cursor in a convenient location where you can then take a breath and say another command.

If you have the same voice command for a global snippet and an app-specific snippet, the app-specific snippet must be defined first in the file.

Also, many of the non alphanumeric characters are very common in every day writing so I've mapped their literal names to pressng the key for them (`dot` presses period, `space` presses space, `slash` presses slash, etc.). This also solves an issue where sometimes if you say something like `type window.location.href` in the terminal or chrome console serenade literally outputs `window dot location dot href` (same bug happens with space and other chars).

cd home | changes to home directory (presses enter)
cancel | Presses control + c
clear console | types clear into the terminal and presses enter


#### Git 
For some reason `serenade.app("term")` did not work so I'm using `serenade.global()` for now. On the bright side these commands work everywhere and always focus the terminal to run the command regardless of what app is currently focused.

Also, "git" gets misinterprated as "get" often so I'm using the word "g" instead and its much smoother.
