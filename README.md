# Serenade Scripts

## Workflows.js

Mostly general text editing commands and app navigation

If you have the same voice command for a global snippet and an app-specific snippet, the app-specific snippet must be defined first in the file.

### Terminal specific commands


#### General terminal stuff

Voice Command | Description 
------------ | -------------
open in code | Must have [VS Code shell command installed](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac)
cd | ...
cd <%text%> | ...
cancel | Presses control + c
clear console | types clear into the terminal and presses enter


#### Git 
For some reason `serenade.app("term")` did not work so I'm using `serenade.global()` for now. On the bright side these commands work everywhere and always focus the terminal to run the command regardless of what app is currently focused.

Also, "git" gets misinterprated as "get" often so I'm using the word "g" instead and its much smoother.
